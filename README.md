# v README
Support package for the v programming language.

## Features

Give pretty colours and useful syntax for the v programming language used at Biton. Some shortcuts for common v functions

- If you type " rc" you get a typed out "set (rc) = " which saves time on creating csvs

- rcoef gives "set (rc) = OpenExtractFile("", "", "", "")"

- rcch gives set "(rc) = ColumnHeading("", "", "", "", "")"

- rcsc gives set "(rc) = SaveCell("", "", )"

- rcnr" gives "set (rc) = NextRow("")"

- rccef gives "set (rc) = CloseExtractFile("")"

- All of these shortcuts exist without the rc prefix, also.

- oef gives "OpenExtractFile("", "", "", "")"

- ch gives "ColumnHeading("", "", "", "", "")"

- sc gives "SaveCell("", "", )"

- nr gives "NextRow("")"

- cef gives "CloseExtractFile("")"

- A prepass template shortcut type prepass" to have a prepass with a sort statement, 3 processes, and a push statement.

- DEBUG shortcuts. "dbgo" gives the DEBUG output line for the top of the file. "dbg" gives a "set DEBUG = " line.

All of these shortcuts and more exist as snippets. Often, they will complete certain common function values for you.
